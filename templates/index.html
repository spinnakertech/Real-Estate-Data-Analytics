          <p>Real Estate Investors, Realtors, and Homeowners all benefit from insights into real estate markets.  The links below explore three inquiries that will allow these groups to make informed decisions about when to purchase, sell, and advise clients about residential real estate markets in the United States.</p>
          <p>The first inquiry, <b>Impact of COVID-19 on the Real Estate Markets in 2020</b>, looks at the impact of a market disrupter, in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic, on real estate markets.</p>
          <p>The second inquiry, <b>Predicting Real Estate Markets for Real Estate Investors</b>, explores several economic factors and builds a Multiple Linear Regression machine learning model to predict future real estate markets.</p>
          <p>The final inquiry, <b>New Homes Sales--a Predictor of Existing Home Sales Real Estate Markets?</b>, assesses whether New Home Sales are a reliable predictor of the Existing Home Sales real estate market.</p>

        <p>Understanding Real Estate Analytics requires an understanding not only of basic economics and statistics but also a deep knowledge of the real estate data that is tracked and reported.</p>
        <p>News reporting about <b>Real Estate Markets</b> often describes the markets as a "hot market" or "slowing market."  What those terms means very much depends on the context of how they are used.  Those general terms should not be relied upon to make decisions about real estate investments, purchases, sales, or trends unless those terms are used in the context of the specific question one is attempting to answer.</p>
        Some Real Estate Data Analytics projects are focused on predicting the market value of a specific property and a recommended sales price.  Such a model is extremely complex and may utilize hundreds of data points and is the foundation for the Zestimate<sup>TM</sup> that is created by Zillow Real Estate Group.<br><br> We do not attempt to improve on Zillow's Zestimate<sup>TM</sup> on this web site. Instead, we focus on the <b>Real Estate Market</b> as a whole rather than pricing of specific properties.</p>
        <p>The Real Estate Analytics projects that we present on this web site focus on the <b>Real Estate Market</b> to assist the user in understanding the "timing the market" in order to make informed buying and selling decisions.</p>
        <p>Even with a similar purpose of understanding <b>Real Estate Markets</b>, however, the data sources and the methodology used very much are dependent on the inquiry presented.</p>
        <p>Our first inquiry, <b>Impact of COVID-19 on the Real Estate Markets in 2020</b>, for example, examines the effect of COVID-19 on the <b>Real Estate Market in 2020</b>. For purposes of this inquiry, we examined home sales over the years and we identified home sales as a combination of three data points:  <b>Homes Sold</b>, <b>New Listings</b>, and <b>Pending Home Sales</b>. We utilized these three data points because we believe that combined, they offer the best representation home sales for the purpose of this inquiry. Furthermore, we used Year-Over-Year comparisons of these three data points rather than actual numbers of sales in order to better visualize the trends of the home sales.</p>
        <p>In our second inquiry, <b>Predicting Real Estate Markets for Real Estate Investors</b>, we examine the number of months supply of housing for sale in orer to to define and analyze the <b>Real Estate Market</b>. We use this specific data to see more detailed trends of the real estate market in order to understand where we are at a specific point in time and how economic factors affect our exact location on the spectrum.</p>
        <p>In our final inquiry, <b>New Homes Sales--a Predictor of Existing Home Sales Real Estate Markets?</b>, we examine the number of homes sold for a given period. This is similar to our first inquiry but in this inquiry, we look at actual sales, not a comparison from one year to the next. We selected this approach to provide us with a meaningful comparison of New Home Sales and Existing Home Sales. The data available for New Home Sales (i.e., new construction) is limited, thus, we have modified the data that we collect for Existing Home Sales to match the type of data that is available for New Home Sales.</p>
